A rogue clone, written in C, using NCurses

Because I have had difficulty getting codepage 437 to display in the default
Ubuntu terminal, this uses unicode characters. I've tested it in the Ubuntu 
terminal, and rxvt-unicode. Other terminals may or may not work.

Note: unicode support requires NCursesw!
